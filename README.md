If using autograd, iterations can take anywhere from 3 - 10 minutes per iteration.

# Future Work

* Optimize Code For faster Autograd (May required not building lists of lists while running and just creating them in the beginning and passing them)
* Test on Larger graph with more nodes
* Look into using Jax (updated version of AutoGrad)
